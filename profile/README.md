Establishing Norms

What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?

	Talk it out and then come to a vote.


Do you vote? Does the whole group get involved? Do you get someone else to decide?

	Every team member will voice their opinions and that come together to make a decision
	
What does this group do when a member is frustrated?

Ask what problem is and try to resolve it as quickly as possible.

What strategy do you use to talk about it? What do you do if you're the frustrated person? What do you do if you're the person someone is frustrated with? Imagine a situation where Person A thinks that Person B is not pulling their weight - write a script for how you think that conversation should go.

Take a break, walk around, clear your head. Ask if they are struggling with something and if they need any help with anything.

What does this group do when we merge our work together?

Review the code, see if there will be any conflicts, and decide as a group if the code is good to merge.
	
Do we do it together? Do we require sign off from someone else?

	Do it together.
	
When does this group ask for help?

	After everyone has tried to solve the problem.
	
After 10 minutes? 15? 20? After everybody's tried to solve the problem? What strategies do we use before we ask for help?

After everyone has tried to solve the problem, we looked through stack overflow to try and figure out a solution.
	
How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?

Given the fact we have 3 people we will run solo and if we are waiting on something we can pair with someone who needs help.

Do members of a pair decide their own norms? Do they do things like keep a timer to switch positions? How often do we switch partners?

	NA

How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)?

	See how far we are, if we feel behind schedule a time to meet.
	
Is it okay to work on your own after hours? How do we keep the group informed? Do we only work after hours when we can pair? When the entire group is present?

Allowed to work outside of class solo but needs to review the new code with everyone during stand up.
	
What time does this group have daily stand up?

	As soon as we join breakout rooms.
